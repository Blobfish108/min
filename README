               = The Min Language =

== What?
Min is a Object-Oriented programming language with
syntax very similar to Ruby with Python's
indentation.

== Why?
Ruby is a very nice language but has many dark
corners that make it hard to implement. I believe
most of those dark corners can be replaced with
approach that don't impact the language
implementation complexity.

== Philosophies
* Clear and simple code is better.
* Less code is better.
* Language core should be implemented in itself.
* No special statements (class, def, if, ...).
