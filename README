                     THE MIN LANGUAGE

Min is a Prototype-based language with syntax inspired by
Io and Ruby topped with Python's indentation. It's aimed at
being the most readable and powerful language ever, really.
Oh and fast too!

== Philosophies
* Everything is an object.
* No special magic statements (if, def, while),
  everything is a method call.
* Open, extensible object model.
* Only 4 constructs: Closure, Object, VTable and Literals.
* As close to English as possible.
* As little parenthesis as possible.
