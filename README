                     THE MIN LANGUAGE

Min is a Prototype-based language with syntax inspired by Io and Ruby topped
with Python's indentation. It's aimed at being the most readable and powerful
language ever, really. Oh, and fast too (but fast enough rather then fastest).

== Philosophies
* Everything is an object.
* No special magic statements (if, def, while, +, &&), everything is a method
  call.
* Open, extensible object model.
* Only 4 core constructs: Block, Object, VTable and Literals.
* As close to English as possible.
* As little parenthesis as possible.

== Credits
