The Min Language
==================

Min is a Prototype-based Object Oriented language
with syntax inspired by Ruby, indentation by Python
and object model by Io.

Philosophies
------------
* Everything is an object.
* No special magic statements (class, def, if),
  everything is a method call.
* Open object model.
* Only 4 constructs: Closure, Object, VTable
  and Literals (Symbol, String, Number, Array, Hash).
