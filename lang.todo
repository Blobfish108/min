- fix precedence of operators: 1 + 2 println # => 2
- () for order of eval
- handle exceptions
- string interpolation in "... #{...} ..."
- implement `return`
- fix negative number : now stuff like -3 is working as expected
                        But -(2+3) isn't, something is still wrong somewhere :(
